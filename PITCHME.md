## Workshop objectives

Through the exercises in this workshop participants will read over a file containing a list of customers. They will then write functions to parse the data and calculate the distance between a mock business and each customer.

They will then identify their mock businesses closest customers and, time permitting, write the results out in geojson which they can visualize on a platform such as http://geojson.io

## Python overview: qualities and conventions

    - Interpreted language
    - Interactive mode
    - Easy to learn/read syntax enforced by indentation
    - Rapid development
    - PEP 8

---

## Installing Python and dependencies

  - Virtualenv: What it is and why itâ€™s useful
  - What are modules and packages
  - PyPi/pip: Where you can find or distribute packages
      - installing, upgrading, searching for packages
  - Requirements.txt - creating and installing from requirements.txt

    Activity 1: Install python in a virtual environment and install dependencies using a requirements.txt file. For review we will just confirm that everyone has everything they need installed to proceed with the workshop

---

## Writing functions

  - Basic function syntax
  - Arguments - default values
  - Our activity will cover reading files, so we will briefly
   cover file i/o and using 'with' to create a context
  Activity 1: Participants will write two functions one that reads data from a csv and a second function that calculates the cartesian distance between two pairs of coordinates

---

## Data Structures and Iterating

  - Strings and string formatting
  - Tuples, Lists, Sets, Dictionaries
  - List comprehensions
  - Generators
  - Decorators

---

## Activity 1:

Participants will read over a text file and parse each record into a dictionary.

---

## Activity 2:

Participants will write a decorator for their distance function that will return a dictionary with the start and end coordinates, and distance value

print distance

## Activity 3:

Participants will use a list comprehension to filter their data by a given distance.
