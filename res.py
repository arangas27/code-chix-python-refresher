Activity 1a: Read over a text file and parse each record into a dictionary

1. Open customers.txt and read the file using `readlines()`

3. Using a list comprehension insert the remaining lines into a new list called 'records'

### Activity 1b: Read over a text file and parse each record into a dictionary

1. Use `.strip().split()` to split your header into a list
2. Modify your list comprehension to split each line into a list with `.strip().split()`
3. At this point you should have a list of lists.
4. Write a second list comprehension that zips the header with each record in your 'records list'

1. One called 'parse_csv' to read customers.txt and return a list of dictionaries.

2. One to that takes a string as an argument. If the string can be converted to
    float, the function should return a float, otherwise is should just return
