A Python Refresher - Cyrus H.  - 5 TAâ€™s w/ python bg

Through the exercises in this workshop participants will read over a file containing a list of customers. They will then write functions to parse the data and calculate the distance between a mock business and each customer.
They will then identify their mock businesses closest customers and, time permitting, write the results out in geojson which they can visualize on a platform such as http://geojson.io
The exercises will be relatively simple, but I will make suggestions of things more advanced developers can do to challenge themselves.

1. Python overview
  a. A little about Python
  b. Python conventions
  c. PEP 8
