Python Refresher Prerequisites

Participants should have Python installed on their machines (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python 3.7 is strongly recommended as all examples will be written for version 3.7.
However, if for some reason participants can't install the latest version, Python 2.7.9 or greater should work for all activities.

Apple machines come with version 2.7 installed. Here are instructions for installing Python 3 using homebrew:

If users have an earlier version of Python installed (prior to 3.3), they will also need to install virtualenv.

Participants should also have the following text file downloaded to their machines:
